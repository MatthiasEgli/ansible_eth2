# Eth2 ansible collection

This is an experimental Ansible collection of roles and playbooks to use for testnets.

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use this in mainnet, as security was not the primary focus of this.
The primary focus is to quickly spin up testnets and automate things that require more care in a mainnet context.
